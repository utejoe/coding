When you start to write a program to solve a problem, one way to do it is to work on the
smallest pieces of the problem. First, you define and write functions for each piece. After
each function is written and tested, you begin to put them together to build a program
that can solve the problem. This approach is normally called bottom-up programming.


On the other hand, to solve a problem, you can first work out an outline and start your
programming at a higher level. For instance, you can work on the main() function at the
beginning, and then move to the next lower level until the lowest-level functions are writï¿¾ten. This type of approach is called top-down programming
