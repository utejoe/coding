<h3>Posting in the wrong place</h3>
<p>You are not to post the same thead twice, be it in the same
section or in two separate sections. Of course we understand that 
you can accidentally hit the submit button twice, but posting a
topic a second time just to give it more attention will result in
one of the topics being deleted or locked dependent on the
situation. If one of the topics has already received helpful
replies, the other topic will be locked, linking to the topic
that will remain open. Accidental double posts will be deleted
without any further consequences for the user.</p>
<h3><a name="farm"></a>Post count farming</h3>
<p>Sometimes people try to boost their post count artificially by
posting short and/or useless messages. This is not to be done,
and we therefore don't allow people to post in forum games very
quickly after eachother. If you posted in one, don't respond to 
it again for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>Bumping topics falls under this category as well. Bumping a 
topic means posting a messge in it just to bring it up to the 
top of the topic list again. Especially in the sections where we
try to help people with their programming problems, this is quite
annoying. Don't do it. YOur topic will get attention, just be patient.</p>

<h3>CAPS etc.</h3>
<p>We're a community, therefore we shuld be able to communicate
properly. So don't write posts with only caps, and try no to use
shorthand words (so how r u today?) and things in similar vain. </p>

<h3><a name="ads"></a>Advertising</h3>
<p>Advertising web sites or products that you are in some way
affilitated with is not allowed. this goes for any all 
advertisements. Advertisements will be removed instantly, no 
exceptions.</p>
