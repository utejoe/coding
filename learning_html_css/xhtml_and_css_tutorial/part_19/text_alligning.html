Python Cookbook, by Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft, 
        and David Ascher, goes over common tasks you encounter
         when coding, and it reviews which ways are the most 
         efficient or less error-prone, and why. There is also a 
         later edition, written by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones, for Python 3.
